myadm - mysql admin
===================
myadm is a simple, small, and fast MySQL TUI.


Status
------
Many code cleanups and a bit of refactoring is needed but the design stage has
been completed, now I have a working (and usable) version of myadm. Tests and
contributions are welcomed.


Requirements
------------
In order to build myadm you need the STFL and libmysqlclient header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (myadm is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install myadm (if necessary
as root):

    make clean install


Running myadm
-------------
Open a terminal and type the following:

	myadm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of myadm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
